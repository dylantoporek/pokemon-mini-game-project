# Pokemon Minigame App

Welcome to my Pokemon Minigame app. Within this app there are two minigames, a pokedex search page, and a favorties page.

# PokeDex

The Pokedex page serves as a way to favortie Pokemon. In addition, you can use it to compare or look up the base stats or types of any Pokemon of your choosing.

# Track

The Track page contains the speed minigame. This minigame will use the speed stat of each Pokemon to determine the winner of the race. You can either choose a Pokemon via a search bar, have a random Pokemon generated for you, or you can use a random Pokemon from your favorites list.

# Battle

The Arena page contains the strength minigame. This minigame will use a series of checks to determine the winner of the battle. First, if your Pokemon's type is super-effective against your opponet (and vice versa) you will win or lose accordingly. If neither type is super- effective, the average of both the attack and special attack stats will be compared for the two Pokemon, the larger attack average will be the winner You can either choose a Pokemon via a search bar, have a random Pokemon generated for you, or you can use a random Pokemon from your favorites list.

# Favorties

The Favorites page contians a display card for each Pokemon you have favorited along with a button to delete them from the favorites page.
